## The `config` Command

```
pomo config
pomo config KEY
pomo config KEY VALUE
pomo config KEY ""
pomo config dir
pomo config path [file]
pomo config edit [file]
```

The `config` command is for reading, writing, and displaying standard
open desktop configuration properties. Pass an empty string to delete
a property.

### Arguments

With no arguments outputs all the currently cached configuration
settings. 

With a single KEY argument fetches the value for that key and outputs
it unless it is one of the following special (reserved) key names:

* `dir` full path to config directory
* `path` full path to specific config file (default: `values`) 
* `edit` opens config file in editor (default: `editor` or `$EDITOR)

With more than one argument the remaining arguments after the KEY will
be combined into the VALUE and written to a `values` file in the
configuration directory. 

### Configuration Directory

The configuration directory path relies on the following environment
variables:

* `EXE` - defaults to name of currently running command (pomo)
* `HOME` - checked for `$HOME/.config/$EXE/values`
* `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` - overrides `$HOME/.config`
* `CONFIG_DIR` - full path to directory containing `values` file

The `CONFIG_DIR` always takes priority over anything else if set, but is
never implied. If the directory does not exist it will be created the
first time a value is set.

### Configuration `values` File Format

The file (which is almost always located at
`~/.config/pomo/values`) uses the simplest possible format to
facilitate standard UNIX parsing and filtering with any number of
existing tools (and no `jq` dependency).

* One KEY=VALUE per line
* KEYs may be anything but the equal sign (`=`)
* VALUEs may be anything but line returns must be escaped

Note that this is *not* the same as Java properties and other similar
format. It is designed for ultimate simplicity, efficiency, and
portability.

## The `help` Command

```
pomo help [COMMAND]
```

Displays specific help information. If no argument is passed displays
general help information (main). Otherwise, the documentation for the
specific argument keyword is displayed, which usually corresponds to
a COMMAND name (but not necessarily). All documentation is written in
GitHub Flavored Markdown and will displayed as a web page if `pandoc`
and `$HELP_BROWSER` are detected, otherwise, just the Markdown is sent
to `$PAGER` (default: more).

Also see `readme` and `usage` commands.

## Generate `README.md` File

```
pomo readme > README.md
```

The `readme` command will output the embedded help documentation in raw
GitHub Flavored Markdown suitable for use as a `README.md` file on
GitHub or similar hosting service.

## The `usage` Command

Displays a summary of usage.
